<h1>Pale Moon Add-ons Site</h1>

<h3>What are Add-ons?</h3>
<p>Add-ons let you customize Pale Moon with extra functionality or a different look.</p>
<p>There are <em>several</em> types of add-ons. <em>Extensions</em> expand the capabilities of the browser, <em>themes</em> allow you to personalize Pale Moon's visual aesthetic, and <em>plugins</em> further extend the browser with specialized external components such as the <a href="http://get.adobe.com/flashplayer/" target="_blank">Adobe Flash Player</a>.</p>

<h3>Pale Moon's Add-ons Support has changed. Again.</h3>
<p>
  Starting with Pale Moon 30.0.0 technological support for unmaintained Firefox Extensions has been restored. 
</p>
<p>  
  This was accomplished by changing Pale Moon's internal application ID to the original Firefox identifier. Going forward, the ID that Pale Moon 25-29 used will no longer be valid.
</p>

  <small><em><strong>Please note:</strong> The offerings and features of the new Add-ons Site Service will initially be limited. This is a temporary condition due the Milestone (30.0.0) release being pushed up to address a critical security vulnerability affecting then-current and older versions.</em></small>
